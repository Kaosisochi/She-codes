# print("hello world")

# thistup = ("one")
# print(type(thistup))

# 1. Write a Python program to create a tuple. 

tupi = input('values(separate with comma): ')
tup = tuple(tupi)
print(tup)
tu1 = tup[0:(0.5*-1)]
tu2 = tup[(0.5*-1):-1]
print(tu1)
print(tu2)


# 2. Write a Python program to create a tuple with different data types. 
# print("Kindly put a comma after each inputed value")
# tup1 = (input('numbers: '))
# tup2 = (input('words: '))
# tup3 = (input('true/false: '))
# tu = str(tup2)
# tupT = (tup1+", "+tu+", "+tup3)
# print(tupT)

# Currentproblem: printing tupT in () so it'll be a tuple


# 3. Write a Python program to create a tuple with numbers and print one item.


# 4. Write a Python program to unpack a tuple in several variables.
